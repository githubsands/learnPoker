# your best source of information to combat uncertainity are the people holding the cards. it is their decision, their strategies, the behaviors, their tells
# chaotic complex machines - called human minds 
# game theory: take advantage of these predictions to influence the journey of the system and land it to your advantage. 
# data to know where the system is heading

# do the variables have a semblance of information -- despite inaccuracies, or noise?  -- that support your ability to test and explain a casual process? 
# you are using bad-data when you have over-read
# as a data scientist looking for casual processes, you must develop hypothesis, you must seek stories

# Three levels of reasoning:
# 1. my hand vs your hand
# 2. my hand vs your range of hands - exploitative play
#       - You can go very far with L2 reasoning if you can build reasonable methods for your opponents models 
#           for your opponents range and correctly compute the equities of hands. 
#       - L2 reasoning is best targeted towards individual opponents with specific tendencies thta you are trying to take advantage of. 
# 3. my range vs your range of hands - optimal play
#       - 
# the importance of position:
# 1. How many players are remaining to compete vs. me for the blinds?
# 2. The fewer the players, the less strong my hand needs to be to attack the blinds
#
# equity: the probability of your cards winning the pot once all the remaining cards are dealt.
